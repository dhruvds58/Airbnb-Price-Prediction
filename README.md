# üè† **Airbnb Price Prediction Project**  

### *Leveraging Machine Learning to Analyze and Predict Listing Prices*  

---

## üìñ **Project Overview**  
This project explores and predicts the prices of Airbnb listings using a dataset that includes factors such as location, property type, amenities, and customer reviews. Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and machine learning models, the project uncovers critical trends, relationships, and influences on Airbnb pricing.  

The goals of this project include:  
- Identifying key factors influencing listing prices.  
- Building predictive models to estimate prices with high accuracy.  
- Providing data-driven insights to help hosts optimize their pricing strategies.

## üöÄ **Key Features**  

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
- Missing values were handled for key features like `price`, `reviews_per_month`, and `availability_365`.  
- Outliers, particularly extreme prices, were detected and addressed to improve model stability.  
- Engineered new features, such as **average neighborhood price** and **listing popularity**, for enhanced predictions.

## üìä **Key Insights and Visualizations**  

### 1. **Location is a Key Driver of Price**  
Listings in prime neighborhoods and close to city centers or popular tourist attractions tend to have higher prices.

### 2. **Reviews and Ratings Influence Pricing**  
Highly rated properties with many reviews often attract higher prices, reflecting customer trust and satisfaction.

### 3. **Seasonality Affects Pricing Trends**  
Pricing trends exhibit seasonal variations, with higher prices during peak travel seasons and holidays.

*Line chart showing average monthly prices.*  

### 4. **Amenities Add Value**  
Premium amenities like hot tubs, pools, and parking increase the price of a listing, with notable variation across property types.

## üß† **Modeling Process**  

### 1. **Data Preparation**  
- Converted categorical variables like `room_type` and `neighborhood` into numerical encodings.  
- Standardized numerical features, such as `price`, `minimum_nights`, and `availability_365`.  

### 2. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
- Models tested:  
  - **Linear Regression:** Simple and interpretable baseline model.  
  - **Random Forest Regressor:** Robust and non-linear model that handled complex relationships well.  
  - **XGBoost:** Achieved high performance with optimized hyperparameters.  
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor, with strong performance on the test set:  
  - **R¬≤ Score:** 0.81  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** $28.45
